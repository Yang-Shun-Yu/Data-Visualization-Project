# Sankey Diagram

## Objective

Craft a Sankey Diagram to represent car evaluation data using D3.

## Example Code

[Sankey Diagram Example Code](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/sankey.html)

## Data Source

Data Source: [Car Evaluation Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation)

## Requirements

### Data Preparation

1. Preprocess the data to ensure valid pairings between attributes for the Sankey Diagram.
2. Calculate frequency counts for each category combination across the mentioned attributes.

### Sankey Diagram Creation

1. Display relationships between the categorical attributes: buying, maintenance, doors, persons, luggage boot, and safety.
2. Ensure the width of the bands in the Sankey Diagram represents the proportion or count of the dataset that holds that relationship.

### Design & Interactivity

1. **Draggable Nodes:**
   - Allow users to rearrange Sankey nodes to declutter the view or focus on specific relationships.

2. **Tooltips:**
   - Implement interactive tooltips that show ratios or raw counts when users hover over the bands in the Sankey diagram.

3. **Visual Design:**
   - Ensure clear color distinction for different categories.
   - Provide a legend or key that explains any color or symbol used.
